# collegues-api

A web-application to manage a list of colleagues

To access colleagues profiles you need to authenticate before(check "connect" button).
An admin can change and add a colleague's profile, a user can only see without changing.

Take a look at our new trombinoscope in 'Gallerie' tab.

Try with these names: Le Gallois, juju, SIR, Coco (not case-sensitive)
